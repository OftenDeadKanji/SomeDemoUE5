# SomeDemoUE5
Well, I'm just learning UE5. I'm using both C++ and Blueprints to add game logic.

So far I added:
- 3 types of doors - <b>automatic</b> (they open when played is near them), opened <b>by switch</b>, manually opened if the player has proper <b>key</b> in inventory
- when player looks at interactive object, proper info is displayed in HUD
